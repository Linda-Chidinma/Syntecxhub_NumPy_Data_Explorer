# NumPy Data Explorer

This repository contains a NumPy Data Explorer project completed as part of the
Syntecxhub Virtual Internship program.

## Project Objectives
- Explore NumPy array creation, indexing, and slicing
- Perform mathematical and statistical operations
- Apply reshaping and broadcasting techniques
- Save and load NumPy arrays
- Compare NumPy performance with Python lists

## Tools Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Reflection

Through this project, I strengthened my understanding of NumPy arrays and numerical computing in Python. I also learned how to structure a data exploration project professionally for portfolio use.
